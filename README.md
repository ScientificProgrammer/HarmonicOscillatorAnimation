# HarmonicOscillator - Introduction
I wanted a good animation of Hooke's Law, which demonstrates the oscillating behavior of a weight attached to a spring, where, over a limited range, the force applied to stretch the spring is linear with respect to a "force constant" that is a property of the spring itself.

# Methods
Code was written in R and animation performed with the gganimate package.
